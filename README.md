## Mobs
### Iceologer
This hostile mob can not only attack you using an iron axe, it can also drop ice blocks on your head. Be careful when you explore!

### Moobloom
Mooblooms are friendly mobs. They are cows with a flower on it's back. When bees come near it, they immediately get some nectar, so mooblooms are perfect for honey farms!
